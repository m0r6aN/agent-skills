# WGT-P0A session handoff — Foreman record reconciliation

**Parcel:** WGT-P0A
**Role:** bounded builder
**Date:** 2026-08-01
**Starting commit:** `f807422d54c9cf2d10c48bdbfd712c01be0d2082`
**Prior checkpoint:** historical pre-final-handoff state; not current-state
authority.
**Review/publication binding:** the exact branch `HEAD` at fresh-review
dispatch is authoritative. No record changes are permitted after dispatch.
The coordinator records the resulting SHA in the publication evidence and
verifies that the published commit is the reviewed commit.

## Result

Prepared the exact-scope Foreman record reconciliation after verifying the
tracked bootstrap evidence. The historical pre-bootstrap missing-source stop
is preserved as history and explicitly resolved by merged PR #4 / PR #5
evidence. The current queue is `WGT-P0A -> WGT-P0B -> WGT-P0C`, followed by
the ratified dependency-ready queue. Gate 1 is closed; Gate 2 is scoped to
named agent parcels; Gate 3 is withheld per parcel; G2 is open; G4 is not
established; H5/H6A/H6B/H7P/H7/H8 are open/not performed.

The allowed `docs/specs/done/` destination was intentionally not changed.
Stage F must archive the active spec only after the independent reviews, Gate 3
decision, and coordinator closeout conditions are satisfied.

  The search was read-only and caused no Linear mutation; no issue, document,
  backlog item, or WGT record was created or edited. `discovery.md` is
  historical and outside the exact six-file scope, so it remains untouched.
- Outreach state is inherited from the user-authorized verified starting-state
  directive: KPM-06 is prepared as `PRE-G2 / DO NOT SEND`, the exact
  ten-recipient Gmail Sent result is zero, and no KPM-07 actual-send receipt is
  available. These statuses are recorded but unverified/held because no durable
  repo receipt is available in agent-skills. P0A did not search Gmail or mint a
  receipt; reply monitoring remains blocked. Kaseya remains excluded.

## Commands and checks

The prior checkpoint is historical provenance only. Exact rework checks are
recorded below; the fresh-review target is the exact branch `HEAD` at dispatch.
Publication is prohibited if the reviewed SHA and published SHA differ.

| Command | Exact result |
|---|---|
| `git rev-parse HEAD` | re-run at fresh-review dispatch; the dispatch SHA is authoritative |
| `git branch --show-current` | `codex/wgt-p0a-foreman-reconciliation-20260801` |
| `git status --short --branch` | re-run at fresh-review dispatch; must be clean |
| `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD` | re-run at fresh-review dispatch; must be exactly the permitted current paths |
| `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` | re-run at fresh-review dispatch; must exit `0` with no output |
| `git diff --check` | re-run at fresh-review dispatch; must exit `0` with no output |
| exact six-file scope comparison | PASS: changed paths are a subset of the six Allowed Files; no outside path is present |
| `npm --prefix plugins/foreman-line/spec-linter run typecheck` | Not a P0A prerequisite; not run |
| `plugins/foreman-line/spec-linter/node_modules/.bin/tsx.cmd plugins/foreman-line/spec-linter/src/cli.ts validate plugins/foreman-line/docs/specs/active/WGT-P0A-foreman-record-reconciliation.md` | PASS; no violation output |
| Markdown whitespace check: `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD -- '*.md'` | exit `0`; no output |

The Linear search was read-only/no mutation. `discovery.md` is historical and
outside scope. The spec-linter typecheck was not a P0A prerequisite and was not
run; because no TypeScript, product, package, or test file changed, P0A
acceptance relies only on active-spec validation, spec-linter lint, diff scope,
and diff-check. Two independent reviews returned **HOLD**, not **PASS**: one
for missing durable timestamped Linear provenance and one for missing exact
handoff command results/pinned content commit.

## Stage F closeout

Two fresh independent read-only reviews returned PASS at the exact reviewed
head `ec4e02d057db594206cdfac35471ea7b445caea0`, with no unresolved Blocker,
High, or Medium finding. PR #6 merged unchanged at
`8276691fd058dcde600dcb1374fd22d305c4a7a8`, and fresh `origin/main` was
verified at that commit. The active parcel spec was archived under
`plugins/foreman-line/docs/specs/done/`; no active WGT-P0A spec remains.

## Blockers and decisions needed

- No Step 0 mismatch or missing Allowed File remains.
- No P0A blocker remains. G2, named human/external gates, and the no-send,
  no-monitoring, no-payment, no-publication, no-customer-data, and Kaseya
  boundaries remain active.

## Next safe action

WGT-P0A is merged and closed. The next implementation action is WGT-P0B in a
separate `keon-docs` repo-owned branch/worktree. WGT-P0C is deferred until P0B
is independently verified and is the only later step that may reconcile Linear.
