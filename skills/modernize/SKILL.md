# Objective

Modernize a legacy system by deriving behavioral contracts from evidence, validating contracts with human review, implementing in a target-native architecture, and proving equivalence within defined drift tolerances.

## Overview

Legacy rewrites usually fail one of two ways: a line-by-line port that drags the old architecture's problems into the new stack, or a from-scratch reimagining that quietly drops behavior nobody remembered to specify. This skill avoids both by making approved behavioral contracts — not the legacy source, and not an engineer's mental model — the only implementation truth. Discovery extracts contracts from evidence, a human validation gate approves them before any implementation starts, the target is built idiomatically against the approved contracts only, and reconciliation proves equivalence with replayable receipts rather than asserting it. At enterprise scale, this runs as choreography — a tree of autonomous discovery/implementation processes reporting into shared durable state — with a primary agent watching for coverage and gate readiness rather than blocking on every step.

## When to Use

- Rebuilding a legacy system in a new stack while needing provable behavioral equivalence, not just a "looks the same" rewrite
- A team needs auditable, replayable evidence that the new system matches the old one within defined tolerances
- The migration is large enough to need contract-first discovery and a human approval gate before implementation begins
- Consolidating or replacing a system where undocumented behavior (Hyrum's Law dependencies) must be discovered before it's broken
- Following on from `get-app-specs` (Phase 0) to turn a baseline specification into approved contracts and a target implementation

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Treat approved contracts as the only implementation truth.
2. Do not perform line-by-line translation from source to target.
3. Require verified, forgery-resistant human approval before implementation starts; the gate re-verifies a signed approval artifact every time and never trusts a self-asserted approval flag (see Approval Gate).
4. Attach evidence to every behavioral claim.
5. Escalate ambiguity instead of guessing behavior.
6. Block release if reconciliation fails.
7. A node leaves `started` only by writing its own terminal state (`done`/`failed`); the primary watches and never auto-reaps or requeues.
8. Do not open a phase-transition gate until a coverage check proves every discovered node of the closing phase reached a terminal state.
9. Never claim parity a run hasn't earned: receipts and `DEFENSIBILITY.md` assert only the claim tier justified by reconciliation actually executed against captured legacy samples. No recon / no legacy samples / no paired comparisons -> `unverified`, no parity claim (see Claim Ladder).

## Execution Model - Choreography of Process-Skills

Enterprise modernization needs discovery *and* implementation at scale; a single agent is a context and throughput chokepoint. This skill runs as **choreography, not orchestration**: autonomous process-skills decompose the work recursively, report into shared state, and a primary agent acts as **watcher, not blocker**.

**Processes are skills.** Decomposition lives in versioned skills, not per-run improvisation. `get-app-specs` is the discovery process primitive; recursion is a process invoking the process on a narrower scope (subsystem -> project -> module -> component).

**The node tree is the durable source of truth.** Every process invocation is a row in the `nodes` table (`schemas/task_store.sql`, SQLite, materialized as `task_store.db`). A node is created `pending`, moves to `started` when it runs, and leaves `started` **only by writing its own terminal row** (`done` or `failed`). The primary never mutates a child's terminal state on its behalf.

**State split (QCC pattern).** Durable node tree + results live in SQLite (`task_store.db`). Ephemeral presence lives in Redis and is **advisory only**: a last-seen signal used to decide *when* to raise an investigate flag for a still-`started` node. It carries **no lease, no TTL-reclamation, and no requeue semantics. There is no reaper.** A worker-pool/lease-reaper topology is explicitly rejected here - wrong shape for a supervised tree.

**Watcher, not blocker.** The primary observes the node tree and updates it as processes report. A node stuck in `started` with absent presence and no terminal row is a **signal to investigate** - it does **not** lock the run and is **never** auto-reaped. This is resilient to partial failure where a synchronous join would deadlock.

**Loud vs quiet failure (mandatory).** Async trades a loud deadlock for silent incompleteness - worse for a proof skill. Therefore: every process emits a **terminal `done`/`failed`** (a `failed` node records `failure_reason`; it never just goes quiet), and a **coverage check** confirms every *discovered* child reached terminal before a baseline or phase is declared complete. A tree with dangling `pending`/`started` nodes is **not** complete. The store enforces this: see views `v_open_nodes` and `v_phase_coverage`.

**Watching is not reconciling.** Cross-process contradictions (frontend assumes a field the backend never emits) require an explicit **reconcile step**, not passive aggregation. Aggregation gathers; reconciliation resolves conflicts and catches the lie.

**Gates bind to phase transitions, not tree depth.** A discovery tree five levels deep still has exactly ONE discovery->implementation gate (Phase II). Intra-discovery joins need *coordination* (the coverage check), not *approval*. Each node records its `phase`; a phase-transition gate may open only when that phase's `open` count in `v_phase_coverage` is zero.

**Governance.** Depth is a proxy that lies (6x4x10 leaves >> 2^6). The real levers, persisted per run/node:
- **Spawn budget** allocated downward - each node spends children from its parent's allotment (`spawn_budget_total` / `spawn_budget_used`).
- **`max_concurrency`** - a ceiling on simultaneously `started` nodes (`runs.max_concurrency`).
- **`max_depth` ~ 5** - a dumb fuse (root -> subsystem -> project -> module -> component), not the primary control. Budget is the control.

## Approval Gate (Phase II -> III/IV)

The discovery->implementation gate requires a **forgery-resistant approval artifact** in `contracts/MANIFEST.yaml` - never a self-asserted flag. Block shape: `schemas/approval.schema.json`. Full playbook: `references/approval-verification.md`.

- **The artifact.** An `approval` block whose trust comes from a **signed git tag/commit** (or detached signature) produced by an allowlisted approver key - something the agent cannot author. It records `approver`, `approved_at`, `method`, the signing-key fingerprint, the immutable signed `object`, and `manifest_hash`.
- **`manifest_hash`** = SHA-256 over canonical JSON of the manifest with the `approval` block removed; it transitively binds contract bodies via per-contract `content_hash` entries in `contracts/MANIFEST.yaml` (schema `schemas/manifest.schema.json`). Approve manifest A and you cannot swap in B.
- **Verify live, on every transition.** Re-run all checks before opening the gate: (1) Phase I coverage clear; (2) `approval` valid vs schema; (3) signature verifies AND signer is allowlisted; (4) ref resolves to the recorded `object`; (5) the hash in the signed message == `approval.manifest_hash` == freshly recomputed hash; (6) every contract still matches its recorded content hash. Any failure -> ABORT, stay in Phase II, emit the failing check.
- **Never trust a stored boolean.** There is no `verified` field; a prior PASS is evidence, not authority. Record each decision in `receipts/approval_verification.json`.
- **Trust assumption.** This holds iff no allowlisted private signing key is reachable by the agent's execution environment.

## Claim Ladder (Receipts & DEFENSIBILITY.md)

Equivalence is bounded by sampling against **captured legacy behavior** - recording only the target proves nothing. Receipts and `DEFENSIBILITY.md` may assert only the tier the evidence earns. Block shape: `schemas/claim.schema.json`. Algorithm + DEFENSIBILITY.md template: `references/defensibility-and-claims.md`.

- **Tiers.** `unverified` (recon didn't run, or 0 legacy samples, or 0 paired comparisons - **no parity claim**); `partial` (ran against legacy, unwaived coverage/contract gaps - bounded claim, gaps named); `verified` (ran against legacy, all targets met or tombstone-waived - equivalence *within drift tolerance, bounded by coverage*; never "identical"); `failed` (strict-field drift beyond tolerance - block release, rule #6).
- **Paired comparison.** A legacy<->target comparison needs BOTH sides for the same stimulus. Target-only recordings can never lift the tier above `unverified`.
- **Recompute, don't trust.** The tier is a function of the sample/comparison/coverage counts, computed at emission - never a stored field. A receipt may not assert above its tier; at `unverified` it carries no parity assertion.
- **Waivers are named, not laundered.** A coverage gap accepted via `TOMBSTONES.md` keeps `verified` but stays listed in DEFENSIBILITY.md. Unwaived gaps force `partial`.

## Phase Workflow

### Phase 0 - Specification Baseline

Action:
- Run `$get-app-specs` on the source repository unless a current baseline spec is already provided.
- Use the resulting app spec as the canonical inventory of features, business rules, dependencies, and domain canon.

Entry criteria:
- Repository access is available.
- Scope boundaries are defined (what is in and out of modernization scope).

Exit criteria:
- `APP_SPECIFICATION.md` exists and is reviewed.
- Baseline includes confidence labels and open questions.
- Blocking low-confidence items are either resolved or explicitly accepted for discovery follow-up.

### Phase I - Discovery and Contract Drafting

Action:
- Inventory source evidence: APIs, code, tests, logs, traces, schemas, runtime config.
- Draft behavioral contracts mapped to baseline spec IDs.

Entry criteria:
- Baseline spec is available (from Phase 0 or user-provided equivalent).

Exit criteria:
- `contracts/DRAFT_MANIFEST.yaml` exists.
- Each contract includes source evidence pointers.
- Coverage report exists showing which baseline requirements are mapped or pending.
- Coverage check passes: every discovered discovery node reached a terminal state (`done`/`failed`) - no dangling `pending`/`started` nodes (`v_open_nodes` is empty for this phase).

### Phase II - Human Validation Gate

Action:
- Review draft manifest with stakeholders.
- Resolve ambiguities and conflicting interpretations.
- Record approved divergences in `TOMBSTONES.md`.

Entry criteria:
- Draft manifest is complete enough for review.

Exit criteria:
- `contracts/MANIFEST.yaml` validates against `schemas/manifest.schema.json` (per-contract `content_hash` entries + a valid `approval` block) and passes Approval Gate verification; `receipts/approval_verification.json` records the PASS.
- Open ambiguities are closed or explicitly deferred with owner and due date.
- Tombstones are documented for all approved behavioral differences.
- This is the single discovery->implementation gate regardless of discovery-tree depth; it requires the Phase I coverage check to have passed.

### Phase III - Target Architecture and Task Graph

Action:
- Produce target-native design in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Build the implementation task graph as nodes in the choreography node tree (`task_store.db`; see Execution Model), each mapped to contract groups.

Entry criteria:
- The Approval Gate verifies live (signed approval artifact + manifest-hash match, signer allowlisted). Re-verify on entry; a prior PASS or a stored flag is never sufficient.

Exit criteria:
- Architecture decisions reference contract groups.
- Task plan maps each contract to implementation and test tasks.
- No task claims behavior outside approved contracts.

### Phase IV - Implementation and Contract Tests

Action:
- Implement only behavior described in approved contracts.
- Add tests per contract and generate telemetry evidence.

Entry criteria:
- Approved manifest and architecture are available.

Exit criteria:
- Contract tests pass at required threshold.
- Telemetry includes traceable contract IDs.
- Receipts are generated and replay scripts run successfully.

### Phase V - Reconciliation and Release Decision

Action:
- Capture BOTH legacy and target behavior samples for the same stimuli (a parity claim needs paired comparisons; target-only recordings prove nothing).
- Execute stratified reconciliation sampling against the captured legacy samples.
- Compare legacy and modernized outputs using drift rules.
- Compute the parity claim tier from the evidence (see Claim Ladder) and publish coverage, sampling, and delta reports.
- Emit `receipts/manifest.json` (with the `claim` block) and `DEFENSIBILITY.md` at the earned tier - never above it.

Entry criteria:
- Implementation phase is complete with receipts.

Exit criteria:
- Reconciliation ran against captured legacy samples with >= 1 paired comparison per claimed contract (else tier is `unverified` and no parity may be claimed).
- Strict fields are within configured drift tolerance (else tier is `failed` - release blocked, rule #6).
- The `claim` block validates against `schemas/claim.schema.json`; receipts and `DEFENSIBILITY.md` assert nothing above the earned tier; unwaived coverage/contract gaps are named (tier `partial`).
- Release decision is documented with evidence links and the earned claim tier.

## Contract Requirements

Every contract file must include:
- Contract ID and version
- Linked baseline requirement IDs (for example `F-*`, `BR-*`, `R-*`, canon IDs)
- Inputs and preconditions
- Execution trigger
- Expected outputs
- Side effects with explicit assertions
- Error handling behavior
- Determinism strategy
- Evidence pointers (`path:line`) to source artifacts

Store contracts in versioned YAML and validate against:
- `schemas/contract.schema.json`
- `schemas/wire_contract.schema.json` (when wire-level parity applies)

## Drift Scoring Requirements

Define scoring rules before reconciliation:
- Strict fields (for example status codes, signatures, stable enumerations)
- Ignored or normalized fields (for example timestamps, generated IDs)
- Numeric tolerances for float comparisons
- Ordering semantics (ordered list vs unordered set)

## Failure Conditions

Stop and escalate if any of the following occur:
- Contract coverage is below agreed threshold.
- Required strict fields drift outside tolerance.
- Ambiguities remain unresolved at validation gate.
- Confidence falls below agreed minimum.
- Reconciliation fails.

## Non-Goals

- Do not redefine domain semantics without approved tombstones.
- Do not perform speculative refactors unrelated to contract compliance.
- Do not enforce style preferences that conflict with contract behavior.
- Do not assert behavior without source evidence.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I know roughly what the old system did, I don't need a signed approval to start building." | The Approval Gate exists precisely because "roughly what it did" is how scope drifts. Implementation may not start without a live-verified, forgery-resistant approval artifact — a self-asserted flag is never sufficient. |
| "The target only recorded correctly, that's good enough to call it verified." | A parity claim requires paired legacy-vs-target comparisons for the same stimulus. Target-only recordings can never lift the claim tier above `unverified`. |
| "This node hasn't reported in a while, I'll just mark it done and move on." | A node leaves `started` only by writing its own terminal state. The primary never mutates a child's terminal state on its behalf — a stuck node is a signal to investigate, not a box to check. |
| "The reconciliation report reads roughly right, I'll write it up as verified." | The claim tier is recomputed from sample/comparison/coverage counts at emission, never asserted from a stored field or gut feel. Unwaived gaps force `partial`; missing legacy samples force `unverified`. |
| "This is basically the same behavior, I'll just implement it the idiomatic way without a contract." | No line-by-line translation, but also no implementation outside an approved contract — "basically the same" is exactly the kind of undocumented drift the contract gate exists to catch. |
| "Depth 6 is fine, we don't need to worry about spawn budget." | Depth is a proxy that lies — a shallow tree with high fan-out can explode as easily as a deep one. Spawn budget and max_concurrency are the real governance levers, not depth alone. |

## Red Flags

- Implementation work starting before `contracts/MANIFEST.yaml` carries a live-verified, signed approval artifact
- A parity or reconciliation claim with zero paired legacy/target comparisons behind it
- A node sitting in `started` with no terminal row and no one investigating why
- A phase-transition gate opened while `v_open_nodes` / `v_phase_coverage` still shows open nodes for that phase
- A `DEFENSIBILITY.md` or receipt asserting a tier the evidence doesn't support (e.g. "verified" with unwaived coverage gaps)
- A tombstoned semantic divergence that isn't listed in `TOMBSTONES.md`
- Strict-field drift outside tolerance that wasn't escalated to block release
- A contract amendment applied without updating its dependent fixtures, tests, or specs

## Verification

Before declaring a modernization run complete:

- [ ] `APP_SPECIFICATION.md` exists with confidence labels and resolved (or explicitly accepted) low-confidence items
- [ ] Every contract in `contracts/MANIFEST.yaml` carries a `content_hash`, links to baseline requirement IDs, and cites source evidence
- [ ] The Approval Gate was verified live at Phase III entry (signature, signer allowlist, ref resolution, hash match) — not assumed from a prior PASS
- [ ] `coverage_check.md` shows every discovered node reached a terminal state (`done`/`failed`) for each closed phase
- [ ] Reconciliation ran against captured legacy samples with ≥1 paired comparison per claimed contract
- [ ] The `claim` block in `receipts/manifest.json` validates against its schema and matches the tier actually earned
- [ ] `DEFENSIBILITY.md` states what was proven, what coverage was achieved, and what was not verified
- [ ] Receipts are replayable (`receipts/replay.sh`/`.ps1` runs successfully against `receipts/hashes.sha256`)

## Final Instruction

Optimize for defensibility, replayability, and evidence. If equivalence cannot be proven with receipts and reconciliation artifacts against captured legacy samples, the run is `unverified` - record that honestly and claim nothing more. Proof, not vibes.
